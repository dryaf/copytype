### Copy Type

Types text instead of pasting.

#### How?

Copy Text into the programm, set the seconds for the timer and hit the button.
After x seconds it will type the text you provided (OSX, us only at the moment)

#### Why?

Sometimes when working for bigger companies you only get some web based shell access or you need to use some rescue web based kvm. In case "pasting" doesn't work you can use this little helper tool.

OVH KVM Web Terminal for example doesn't support pasting.
